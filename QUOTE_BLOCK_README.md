### Method 2: Manual Authoring in Word/Google Docs

If you're authoring in a document (Word/Google Docs), use this table structure:

| Quote |
|-------|
| "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." |
| Winston Churchill |
| Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom |

Then:
1. Convert to markdown/HTML
2. Preview on your local environment

### Method 3: Direct HTML/Markdown

Create a div with class `quote`:

```html
<div class="quote">
  <div>
    <div>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.</div>
  </div>
  <div>

## üìö Understanding the Implementation

### The _quote.json File

This file tells Universal Editor about your Quote block:

```json
{
  "definitions": [
    {
      "title": "Quote",
      "id": "quote",
      // Registers the block in Universal Editor
    }
  ],
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "quote",
      "fields": [
        // Defines the editable fields in the UI
        // - quote (richtext)
        // - author (text)
        // - role (text)
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### The quote.js File

This JavaScript file:
1. Receives the block element with authored content
2. Extracts quote text, author, and role from table rows
3. Creates semantic HTML (`<blockquote>`, `<cite>`)
4. Adds proper CSS classes for styling
5. Preserves Universal Editor instrumentation attributes

### The quote.css File

This stylesheet provides:
- Beautiful gradient background with hover effect
- Large decorative quotation mark
- Responsive typography
- Author attribution styling
- Multiple style variants (emphasis, minimal, dark)
- Mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

## üé® Customization Ideas

Want to make it your own? Try these:

### 1. Change Colors
Edit `quote.css` and change:
- Background gradient colors
- Author name color (`#e34850`)
- Quotation mark color

### 2. Add Icons
Instead of quotation mark, add an icon:
```css
.quote-mark-open::before {
  content: 'üí¨';
}
```

### 3. Add Animation
Make quotes fade in:
```css
.quote-container {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
```

### 4. Add a Company/Source Field
Edit `_quote.json` to add a fourth field for company/publication.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Quote block doesn't appear in Universal Editor
- Make sure you ran `npm run build:json`
- Check that `component-definition.json` includes "Quote"

### Styles not loading
- Check browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- Look for `blocks/quote/quote.css` (should be 200 OK)
- Clear browser cache

### Quote text not formatting correctly
- Make sure your authored content has proper structure
- Check that `quote.js` is loading without errors
- Open browser console for JavaScript errors

### Block appears but no styling
