## üìã How to Add Section Metadata

If you want to use a style variant:

2. Add a "Section Metadata" block below it
3. Add a row: `Style | emphasis` (or `minimal`, `dark`)

Example structure:
```
| Quote |
|-------|
| Your quote text here |
| Author Name |
| Author Role |

| Section Metadata |
|------------------|
| Style | emphasis |
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Quote Length
- **Short quotes** (1-2 sentences): Work great in all styles
- **Medium quotes** (2-4 sentences): Best in default or emphasis styles
- **Long quotes** (4+ sentences): Use minimal style or consider breaking up

### Author Information
- **Always include** the author name when known
- **Include role** when it adds credibility or context
- **Be specific** with roles: "CEO of Microsoft" vs just "Business Leader"

### When to Use Quotes
‚úÖ **Good uses:**
- Testimonials from customers
- Expert opinions
- Inspirational messages
- Key findings or insights
- Historical or famous quotes

‚ùå **Avoid:**
- Very long quotes (use text blocks instead)
- Quotes without attribution
- Too many quotes on one page (loses impact)
